From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

A small project to practice and demonstrate basic HTML and CSS skills.

Reflections:

Reasonably happy with the outcome. There is still more that could be done, but per the spec, don't be a perfectionist.

Main things would be to restyle the buttons / fix their alignment. I used bootstrap for these as I needed them for CS50 and was experimenting.
Also couldn't figure out a straightforward way to resize images using CSS so ended up using GIMP which was a bit of a distraction.
